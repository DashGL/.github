Since I can’t get Lineage OS working on my Google Pixel, it’s time to start thinking about a back up. Right now I’m thinking the white & black 32GB Nexus 5x. It should have a semi-decent camera, nano-SIM and usb type C connection. And they’re really coming down in price. So I think I’ll get one next year, once my allowance resets.

For my Nextcloud Pi setup to go with it. I think I’ll just use a low-capacity 32GB SD card to host the OS, and then for storage, I think I can use a 256GB usb. And maybe potentially even use two USB’s to mirror all of the data on them for a fail-over solution. I don’t think the NextCloud needs any kind of performance for the memory, so I think I can just use some small usb’t to get two on a system. And then if I need some performance, I can look into active cooling, but I think it should be okay with a decent heat spreader.

The main problem is the desktop. For the monitor I want something at least 15.6″. And I want something usb powered. Which could be a problem, since I think most monitors at that size will want 12V. But on this end, I think it might just be a better idea to borrow some monitors from work and not think about it too much.

On the desktop side, I think it’s pretty easy to put what I want together, but the hard part is getting it into a case. For the storage I can use an SSD, I found a stupidly large heat sink, and then I can probably grab a USB fan for cooling, or maybe even leave it passively cooled. The hard part is finding a case to fit these into, and I’m tempted to give the NES case another try.
