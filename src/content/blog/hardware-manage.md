So getting close to moving, and thinking about hardware for my new house. For some reason I can never seem to get it off the brain. I’m pretty happy for work, I think I’ll be using a Fractal Design Core 1100 with a Ryzen 7 cpu, and then some cheap low-profile radeon GPU running Fedora. For home, I’m split between a lot of different options.

For my home, I’m not entirely sure. I have three options. Using a Raspberry Pi (or maybe other SoC), using my little out-dated AMD A-series APU, or maybe upgrade the extra mini-itx motherboard I have lying around. Right now I have RAM, a cpu, a janky motherboard and a janky cpu. The other catch is that the motherboard is lacking features and only has SATA, and wired internet (no wifi built in). So it kind of depends on what kind of internet i go with at my new place, as well as how much I want to spend on my electricity bill if I buy a decent graphics card.

The other issue is that with a decent computer, I’m also kind of worried about how addicted I will get to minecraft, as right now my play time is greatly reduced by the fact that all I have is a crappy notebook. A better computer might make it more compelling to jump into survival mode if I can actually see what i’m doing.

So I don’t know, I guess I’ll look into getting internet figured out first, by renting a wifi router to get by to start out with and then think about making more plans later, once i’m settled in. And here’s a list of wifi rental: [Wifi Rental](https://simtel.jp/wifi/itemlist_kakaku032866/), so I guess I should pick a day to have it sent to my new house for about a month or so.
