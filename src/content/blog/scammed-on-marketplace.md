Seems like the only thing I talk about on this blog is hardware, so why quit now? Recently I ordered a Samsung Chromebook Plus V2. It’s not that great of a computer, but it has a 1980×1200 inch screen, a touch panel with pen, can fold back into a tablet, with 4GB RAM and 64GB SSD. So it probably has short comings, but for around $350, it’s decent, and something I can play around with.

The problem is what actually arrived is a Samsung Chromebook 3. With a 1376×768 screen, 2GB of RAM and 16GB SSD. Which really sucks because now I need to ship it back to the States in order to get a refund. The box that they sent it to me in is also stupidly huge. So I need to get a new box, get some bubble wrap, and then print all of the labels and take it to the post office. Today I need to print the labels. And tomorrow I need to stop by the post office to get a box, and maybe bubble wrap. So I can take that stuff home and pack it.

Really sucks to have to try and run around to do stuff at the post office outside of work hours. What I’m really annoyed with is how crappy the Chromebook is that they sent me. I wouldn’t mind if I had gotten the wrong thing that was at least half-decent.
