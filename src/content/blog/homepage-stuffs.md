In terms of using wordpress versus something else for the next update of DashGL, I’m tempted to lean towards “something else”. With wordpress I think I could emulate what I want by maybe adding in a few plugins and just add tutorials via posts, and then manually organize them with pages later. But I don’t think wordpress is a very effective tool for managing tutorials in the format that I want to. So I think the first step is going to be to try and get a working web page layout that I like, and then goto work on making a backend for it.

So in terms of web page templates that I like.

[Old Stairwell](https://templated.co/oldstairwell) – I like this one for it’s simplicity. It’s close to the twenty-twelve wordpress theme, but a little more detailed in its execution.

[Editorial](https://templated.co/oldstairwell) – Tempted to go with this option, as it has a left sidebar down the complete left side of the page, and then centers the content to the right. I was tempted to do something like this with a fixed left side bar, but the option to scroll isn’t bad. And the general color use and elements mesh together pretty well.

[Endearing Green](https://templated.co/endearinggreen) – This is another decent one, though it seems like it works best for a tablet width. Which might actually be a better approach as web pages are difficult with desktops as it’s hard to take advantage of the full with effectively. But for cellphones and tablets, the use of space is pretty set in stone. So I might sketch out a cell phone and table website and then try to figure out what the desktop would look like. Also I’m noticing that the layout is important, but you can get away with a lot if the CSS looks nice.

[Keyboard](https://templated.co/keyboard) – Or wow, never mind. Looks like there is something close to what I was thinking of. So I can use this as a reference for making my first layout sketch.

[Also This](https://www.shoutmeloud.com/youtube-alternatives.html) – Not a template, but I like the layout.
