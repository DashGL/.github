Life is always a balance between what’s ideal, practical, and what resources are available. Even is something isn’t fesable, it can still help you figure out what your priorities are, and then think of how to better manage what you have.

### Storage

[Crucial 1TB Nvme](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Crucial-P1%E3%82%B7%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA-Type2280-PCIe3-0x4-CT500P1SSD8JP/dp/B07JWKKBVV/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1540738188&sr=1-2-spons&keywords=1tb%2Bnvme&th=1)  

### Graphics

[MSI Radeon Vega 56](https://www.amazon.co.jp/MSI-RX-56-8G-OC/dp/B077Y8328G/ref=sr_1_1?s=computers&ie=UTF8&qid=1540738255&sr=1-1&keywords=vega+56)

A few things to note. QHD on the monitor is a must. But getting a 27″ wacom monitor is spending a massive amount of money when the 22″ and 13″ versions are signiticantly cheaper. So it could be an idea to use a QHD, or 4k monitor as a main display, and then a [13″ tablet](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0116O4YGE/ref=sspa_dk_hqp_detail_aax_0?psc=1) as a side drawing option.

As for the computer, it’s basically build around the case. The Dan case is a pretty beautiful looking mini-itx case. But then I really don’t like having to shop around for a graphics card and power supply. And with the Gigabyte mother board, it makes a graphics card a lot less necessary with two hdmi out directly on the board with options like the 2400G. Something like the [Udoo Bolt](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/udoo/udoo-bolt-raising-the-maker-world-to-the-next-leve?ref=1m4u1y) would more than cover my use case.

Edit: Though for the sake of argument, I could go with the [MSI Motherboard](https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07FVR42K3/ref=s9u_simh_gw_i7?ie=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07FVR42K3&pd_rd_r=0d2a2937-db7a-11e8-ab80-c165c7535ab5&pd_rd_w=aHtQz&pd_rd_wg=Cd0jz&pf_rd_m=AN1VRQENFRJN5&pf_rd_s=&pf_rd_r=TYPFQ9CK8G490J5RECEX&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=5dde70a7-29ac-4e03-87b0-3d01e50df5bc&pf_rd_i=desktop), and that would give me an excuse for having a graphics card.
