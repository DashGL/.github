I moved `mml.dashgl.com` and `dashgl.com` hosting to gitlab. For `gtk.dashgl.com` I could probably download the entire site as static pages and then host the static pages on Gitlab as I’m probably not going to be adding anymore gtk tutorials. For `blog.dashgl.com`, I’m not taking very much advantage of this site. So I might switch the blogs to minds.com or something where I can post things and not need to manage a VPS.
