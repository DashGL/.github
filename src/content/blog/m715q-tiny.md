I’ve been looking around at desktop computers, and I can’t seem to get around that the ThinkCentre Tiny looks like the best possible desktop option. It’s small, has an AMD processor of either the A-series or Ryzen-APU series. It has DDR4 memory, space for a 2.5″ hard drive (storage) and m.2 nvme (OS), and has two display out ports. And in general the prices seem pretty reasonable, if not even mysteriously cheaper than building a small form factor computer. At work it would be pretty obvious to pop either Fedora, or Debian on it, and at home it would make a pretty good desktop/network storage combination. Basically leave it on all day or most of the time, and have a specific directory mounted and available on the network.
