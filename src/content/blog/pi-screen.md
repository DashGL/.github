Seems like the official screen is the best option. And since I already have one, technically cheaper than buying anything new.

Right now I have the usb boot bit set to be able to boot from usb.  
Need to figure out how to set backight, to make it less bright in general.

Also probably needs a power switch to stay plugged in, and be able to turn on and off.

Probably going to install i3wm, and then use bluetooth devices to connect to it.
