ARM desktop (in what looks like an InWin case). Here’s hoping the Pine64 laptop makes mobile laptops viable. In the meantime I might try to get my hands on a RockPi for testing a more desktop approach to ARM.

### ARM Notebook

ARM notebook news. Unfortunately it looks like the devices supported are on the pricey side. Hopefully we’ll see more.
