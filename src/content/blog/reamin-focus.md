It seems like a long time since I’ve managed to work on anything. In the last couple of days I’ve had some time and I really don’t know what to do with it, so it’s worth writing out what to focus on so I can use my time effectively.

One I should probably add years to my internet hosting. Second I should probably cancel the email plan on my hosting since I’m not using it.  
Third, I’ve had the desire to do a lot of stupid projects with hardware, but I guess that’s pretty normal. This time it’s been tempting to look into server cases. I might add more content to the mythical hardware page I set up.

So onto things that matter.

– SDL examples for OpenGL  
– SVG exports for MML maps  
– New homepage for Dashgl.com  
– Map Testing for MML

Also I need to do some testing with Raspberry Pi’s. I wonder if I can set up a VNC and then do recording on my PC, or see if I need some kind of HDMI recording to get that done.
