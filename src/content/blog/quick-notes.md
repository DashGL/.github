I’ve finally had a chance to start making updates to DashGL again. And quick notes of things todo.

1. Get a new Youtube intro  
2. Sketch out a new Homepage  
3. Figure out what to do with the blog

In this case 1 and 2 are easy, so we can get started on them.  
To follow up with this, I ordered a youtube intro and used it this last week. I think we’ll continue to use it as we continue to make simple 10 minute videos every week.

New homepage is sketched out, designed and ordered. For the blog I think I want to stop this wordpress site to reduce the number of VPS that I have scattered everywhere. Normally I think I’d like to re-use this domain. But there are a few links that I would prefer not to break. So what I’ll do is export everything over as a static site and host it on gitlab with static pages under the same domain. I think any new blog going forward will be done on the homepage directly.
