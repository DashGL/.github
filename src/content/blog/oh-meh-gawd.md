Not sure what’s going on. Tried to install Lineage on my Nexus 5X. Similar story, to the Google Pixel, everything works until it doesn’t. In this case booting into TWRP and installing works without incident, but then the device just gets stuck at the Google logo on boot. I guess I’ll hvae to search around a little more or make the reddit post of shame asking for help.

Moving on, we have other priorities to work on. I want to finish the rest of the Sealos island maps to get those out of the way. I found that it’s pretty easy to hop into Inkscape and sketch out an SVG to import into Blender. The problem in Blender is that the mesh isn’t centered, and then doesn’t scale correctly. So I’ll have to try Librecad to see if there’s any improvement there, or otherwise I’ll just take the time to do the last few by hand.
