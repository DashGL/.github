### DSi

The DSi can now be soft modded. And DSi’s are pretty cheap.Looking at the homebrew it doesn’t look like there’s too much there. File browser, Colors! and emulators. I’m not that interested in the emulators as there isn’t much in the 2d library that I work with. But there could be a few classic DS games that would be worth picking up.

Animal Crossing, Legends of Zelda, Advance Wars, Pokemon, Mario Kart, Fire Emblem, Okami, Pheonix Wright, Disgaea, Rythm Heaven

### PsVita

Originally I was thinking of grabbing the PSP to be on the cheap side, but that was until I hard that the PsVita 2000 series changed from a proprietary power cable to a normal micro-usb cable, so that settles that possibly. I’m not interested in the psVita library very much, mostly the PSP and PSX libraries, but the OLED screen, micro-usb and second analog stick give the psvita a clear advantage over the PSP.

Option between 1000, and 2000. Generally leaning towards 2000 because of micro-usb for charging, smaller size. 1000 has OLED but 2000 still has a pretty good IPS screen. And I might not even get the opportunity to enjoy the 1000 screen if it’s too big to carry around and too annoying to charge.

### Samsung Galaxy S5

This one is a really low priority entry. The Samsung Galaxy S5 seems like the ideal Lineage OS device. After trying the Nexus 5 (no removable battery, no extendable storage) , and Nexus 5x (too big), and Pixel (multi-slot boot), the Galaxy S5 has a removable battery, SD card slot and it was made in an era where phones could actually be used with one hand.

### Wii

Want one of these, have no where to plug it in right now. Seems like cfw is pretty easy to put on it, with an SD card (or usb) could be an option for a general classic game cabinet (nes, snes, n64, psx, gc, wii).

### 2ds LL

Right now cfw doesn’t offer enough advantages over Dsi to make it worth-while. Still the same pool of emulators and 3ds games are still pretty expensive.

### NEC Lavie

Full hd 12.5 thin and light laptop. Probably not enough of a step-up over my Asus Zenbook, but the closest candidate for the kind of hardware that would make me want to update.
