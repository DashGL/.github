I’m in this weird place, where there’s so much to do and it’s hard to figure out exactly where to start from.

Sealos Islands collision hulls was a fun side venture. The later maps get more time consuming. I would like to come back to this, but for now it’s a low priority. There is a lot more focus and need for the first Megaman Legends, and the amount of time put into making something one-off like this might as well be spent towards the first Megaman Legends game.

Dash Interchange Format, the main problem with this is the pointers needed in the archive sections. If I take my time and track the file position on paper, then I think I can get through this. I should try and prioritize finishing this when I get a chance.

Hardware designs are fun, but I think something better will come out by the time I ever get anything viable. I think I’ll stick to buying what parts are available to get as close as possible to the functionality I want. I’ll post the designs (that any idiot could think of) as pages to leave a record. And then I think I can use some kind of board, to screw down the parts, so that the functionality for each of the designs is grouped in someway rather than the parts being all over the place.

It’s been a lot easier finding information for C and SDL after switching to DuckDuckGo for some reason. And I think I’m a lot for familiar with the concepts to be able to start using it now. For tutorials, I want to see if I can make a brickout clone using SDL and OpenGL 1.0. And then port my astroids and invader clones to Opengl 2.0 (which they were intended for). After that I want to make a basic top down, and a basic side scroller (and I mean extremely basic). From there use OpenGL 2.0 for displaying a basic cube. And then OpenGL 3.0 for anything involving a model.

For Megaman Legends 2, I’ll see what I can do to help Xinus track down the ST39 problem. No promises, but I’ll try to budget a week and see what I can come up with. After that I really want to get back into debugging levels to see what I can come up with. And hopefully I’ll be able to ask Trege what he knows on Discord to be able to see if that matches up with what’s in the file.

So basically right now, help Xinus, work on Dash Interchange format and then stages.

Edit : Two more quick notes that don’t deserve their own posts. One is that I feel better about buying an previous generation AMD A-series APU. And the reason being is when I bought it, the AM4 platform was still pretty expensive. And either way it would just be sitting around in my apartment since I don’t have enough room to put a desktop computer. And then also, I need to start thinking about designs for DashGL.com and format.DashGL.com if I’m going to be updating them with new content.
