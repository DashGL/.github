I think I’ll be making a new blog which will take the place of dashgl.com. I think that using GatsbyJs is going to be the best option for creating static content that can be hosted using Gitlab. And then I can set up a Raspberry Pi or machine that can continuously rebuild and push the blog to the web for any updates.

For a blog feed I think i’ll be using Hackmd.io. Which should make it easier to focus on content. I don’t know what it is about WordPress, but I find it very hard to write about actual content. Most of the time it’s off-topic side notes or musings that get posted here. So I think that having an offsite tool that I don’t need to manage should make it easier to focus on content.

I also need to back up my megaman legends threads. I’ll put a list to back up here:
