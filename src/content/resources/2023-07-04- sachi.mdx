Not sure where my brain gets these things. One day my brain figured it would be a good idea to commission a bunch of Linux characters
in a Chibi Style and make them available. The first one that I wanted to try was Sachi the Spirit Fox as I thought it would make a good
proof of concept. 

The mascot is for Squishy: The SCSI Multitool. Squishy is a platform for working with old SCSI devices with modern systems in a 
flexible manner. It was originally developed as a one-off solution for the taperipper project, which was to boot a modern system 
off of a IBM 9348-002 9-track magnetic tape drive. The repository for Squishy can be found [here](https://github.com/squishy-scsi/squishy).

Sachi was designed and illustrated by the amazing [Tyson Tan](tysontan.com). He provides mascot design service for free and open source 
software projects, free of charge, under free license.

The model was created by Vic Wang. Her Artstation page can be found [here](https://vidavic.artstation.com/).
