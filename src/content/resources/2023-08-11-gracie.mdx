More free Chibi characters. This time is [Gracie the Pirate Gazelle](https://tysontan.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/electrichearts_20171204_gazelletracker_gracie.png).
The description of Gracie includes Digital Ocean, but I'm not sure how happy they'd be to have their brand associated with piracy.
Gricie has the share symbol as an emblem. I think that we can say Gracie more embodies the general culture of the internet to share,
and share alike. But that doesn't mean that Gracie is a good person, or animal?

Gracie was designed and illustrated by the amazing [Tyson Tan](tysontan.com). He provides mascot design service for free and open source 
software projects, free of charge, under free license.

The model was created by Vic Wang. Her Artstation page can be found [here](https://vidavic.artstation.com/). The model was commissioned
by Kion. And the model is available under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).
