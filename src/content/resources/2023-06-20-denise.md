I saw this amazing piece that [Luiz Lanzarin](https://twitter.com/geckoboyadvance) made on Twitter
and wanted to see more Megaman Fan Art.

With Megaman Fan Art, I think a lot of art gets devoted to Megaman, Roll and Tron. I wanted
something epic to highlight the overlooked classic of the Miss Adventures of Tron Bonn. 

This was the concept for the piece that I wanted commisioned.

Luiz countered with this sketch.

I loved the angle and the approach. He followed up soon with another draft:

And then more of it quickly came together.

Clean Lines

Base Color Version. I think this reflects the Megaman Legends art pretty closely.

Then with highlights and shading.

There's a little Easter Egg. Is Dashie now part of the Megaman Legends universe!!?
