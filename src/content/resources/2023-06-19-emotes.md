While I would love to be able to hop on switch and stream for a few hours while
reverse engineering or doing some programming, I often don't get enough time between
works and kids to stream and chill. 

Still I thought it would be fun to get some emotes to be able to use somewhere, somehow
or at least be able to improve my neglected Discord server.
