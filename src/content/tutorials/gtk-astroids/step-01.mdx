Simple Astroids clone using assets from Kenney's Space Shooter Redux and 
Space Shooter Extension. The pace of this tutorial will be slightly faster 
than previous tutorials. As concepts that were introduced one at a time before
will now be grouped into a single step. This tutorial will not be drastically
different from the Invaders tutorial. We will mainly focus on movement, 
direction and acceleration. And how to draw the same sprite multiple times to
create a wrapping effect.
