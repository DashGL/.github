Simple Invaders clone using Kenney's Space Shooter redux pack. 
In this tutorial we will include sprites to make a more complete looking game, 
but it will still be fairly simple in nature. We have a group of enemies that 
fire at the player while moving down the screen and a player that can fire back. 
We use static arrays to create a very simple bullet management system. And use 
the pythagorean theorem for basic hit detection.
